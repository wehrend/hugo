== XOR

As there are a lot of important applications for the exclusive-or (XOR) operation
it is dedicated an own blog post. Two of the most important are:

- XOR operations are often used in a Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR). 
LFSR are a crucial step  in scrambler / descrambler respectively, 
which are used in transmitters / receivers
- Part of an encryption algorithmus
- Last but not least an important part of a halfadder.

//as you can expect for a such basic and fundamental operation, but still
//the situation is a bit different with this operation compared to 'and' and 'or'.

The exclusive-or operation xor which is also termed as antivalence
is denoted as A âŠ• B = Q. Its truth table is shown below

== Some Applications

=== Linear Feedback Shift Register (LSFR)
As described above XOR gates are used in Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR).
LFSR are often used for test pattern generation.
The author selected a simple example of a 3-bit LFSR found in a 
https://www.ti.com/lit/an/scta036a/scta036a.pdf[white paper from Texas Instruments].

For this example we need to take a big leap and enter the area of sequential circuits.
These are circuits which make use of feedback. The chosen example generates pseudo-random 
test patterns according to the table below. The registers are feed with the seed value 111,
after 8 clock cycles the patterns repeat again.
Of course real test pattern generators have a much higher bit width.

|================
| CLK  | FF1   |  FF2 | FF3  
| 0    | 1   |  1 | 1  
| 1    | 0   |  1 | 1
| 2    | 0   |  0 | 1  
| 3    | 1   |  0 | 0 
| 4    | 1   |  0 | 0
| 5    | 0   | 1  | 0
| 6    | 1   | 0  | 0
| 7    | 1   | 1  | 0
| 8    | 1   | 1  | 1

=== Halfadder
In the next blogpost we dive deeper into the halfadder application.
The halfadder essentialy consists of the two following particular equations
for sum (making use of the XOR ) and carry (using a simple AND).

\begin{array}{c}
c = x \land y \\
s = x \oplus y
\end{array}
