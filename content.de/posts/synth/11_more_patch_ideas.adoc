So here is another patch idea for the Doepfer A-100 system.
The results of the Doepfer oscillators are pithlily "knarzig-kernige" sounds.
We utilize two A-110 oscillator modules (one standard, one basic), a ring-modulator (A-114)
and a wasp-filter (A-124), together with some utility modules like a sequencer and an LFO.
