So here is another simple patch idea for the Doepfer A-100 system,
this time featuring the SEM filter from Oberheim, incarnated in the Doepfer
modul A-106-5.
We also utilize two A-110 oscillator modules (one standard, one basic), and the LFO.

To this day I did not find the right audio recorder,and I am recording with my smartphone,
so the sound quality is rather bad. I am still searching for the ideal recording hardware.
