So I bought a low cost eurorack case from doepfer and a set of frontpanels plus power adapter
for the pocket operator modular 400 from Oddvolt to put the said machine into a eurorack modular
system. I also bought a small, but decent sequencer, since the one from teenage engineering is not
very handy to use. I have two further modules on my list, the https://doepfer.de/a119.htm[Doepfer A-119],
an input module, as well as the https://doepfer.de/a124.htm[Doepfer A-124], a wasp filter, to complete the setup.
