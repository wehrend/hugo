On my mobile setup, the NiftyVCase I have collected my diy modules (with excepition to the Doepfer
A-124, I had to include for its great sound). It features a kick-drum from erica synths, an even
VCO, Sampling Modulator, A*B+C and Rampage from Befaco. As well as the Divebomb III for some delay.
Last but not least a Zlon skew lfo and a BCM086 Diode Ladder High pass filter.
