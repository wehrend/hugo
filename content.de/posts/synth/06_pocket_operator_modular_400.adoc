With the random module we can sample & hold a signal from the input. Its companionship is the noise module.
We feed the saw output to the input of the rand module.

. sine output -> speaker right
. envelope output -> sine key
. LFO square -> envelope trig

We can expand the setup by using the sequencer and utilize the filter. Because  the nice
thing about modular synthesizers is, that the filter can be used not only in signal paths but
also in control paths ;-) .

. filter output -> sine control
. sequencer output -> filter input
