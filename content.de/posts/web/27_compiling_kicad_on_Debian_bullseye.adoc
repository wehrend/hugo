With my new hobby, there came the desire to learn to build and design my own PCB. With that in mind, I began to use the
open source ecad solution Kicad. Now I became interested in participating in this project, but, to compile the code you
have endure a few challenges - you know, collecting the dependencies,installing them, choose the right branch whiche compiles down
and so on. Here I want to show you my experience with that.

First, clone the gitlab repository:

    git clone https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad.git
    git checkout 8.0

Then, you need to install a couple of dependencies I list them in a hopefully complete list

    sudo apt-get install cmake libgl-dev libglew-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev ngspice xfonts-scalable libocct-data-exchange-dev
    libocct-draw-dev libocct-foundation-dev libocct-modeling-algorithms-dev libocct-modeling-data-dev libocct-ocaf-dev
    libocct-visualization-dev protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev swig python3 python3-pip libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev
    unixodbc unixodbc-dev libsecret1


But cmake and wxwidgets both are too old under Debian Bullseye,so you need to install them separately...

For cmake it is straightforward, you clone the repository and build the program from source:

    git clone https://github.com/Kitware/CMake.git
    cd CMake
    ./bootstrap && make && sudo make install

For wxwidgets its a bit harder, you clone the repository with:

    git clone https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets.git
    git checkout v3.2.4
    cd wxWidgets/
    git submodule update --init src/jpeg
    git submodule update --init src/tiff
    git submodule update --init src/stc/scintilla
    git submodule update --init 3rdparty/catch
    git submodule update --init 3rdparty/nanosvg
    mkdir buildgtk
    cd buildgtk/
    ../configure --with-gtk --prefix=/usr
    make -j3
    sudo make install



Now you are finally ready to build Kicad itself...

    git clone https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad.git
    git checkout 8.0
    mkdir -p build/release
    cmake  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DKICAD_USE_EGL=ON -DKICAD_WAYLAND=OFF  ../../
    make -j3
