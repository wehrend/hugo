As the blog grow bigger and after the move to odoo, I noticed a gap in the workflow,since
a blog and its content itself are different entities, I wanted to handle them as such,
that led me to a cleanup of the original source code for blog, where I moved teh content folder
into a different repo, called hugo_content, the former repo I called hugo_blog.

In my case, this means you have to clone the repo hugo_blog first
go inside the new directory (cd hugo ), checkout its branch 'hugo' and then do a clone of
the repo hugo_content.
