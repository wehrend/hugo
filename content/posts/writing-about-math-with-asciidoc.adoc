While drafting a blog post, part of a series of posts intended to be published in the future,
I discovered a lack of my tooling in Nikola. When adding mathematical formulas, 
I realized that there is no default-way of rendering images from those math formulas,
and inserting them as image-tags into the html. Instead math formulas are handled via JS, which I try 
to reduce to an absolute minimum on my site.
So I started to implement a rather quick-and-dirty plugin to do exactly this transformation, using 
latex and dvipng or dvisvgm. 
Then I come across https://erikwinter.nl/articles/2020/why-i-built-my-own-shitty-static-site-generator/[this blog post] 
where reading about https://asciidoc.org/[asciidoc] written in python and its successor https://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor] written
in ruby supporting different display formats. Ideal for the content I had in mind. So I installed the Nikola plugin asciidoc 
(which is mostly a wrapper to the asciidoc binary called as a subprocess), via

 nikola plugin -i asciidoc

in my local environment and converted my blogpost(s) first semi-automatically which is, due to the metadata-section from 
Nikola, not the very best idea and continued manually.
After some frustrations with the paths for the latex filter inside asciidoc it was working.

So as a sample of one of the future blogposts here one or rather two math-equations rendered this way:

//  ["latex","../images/half-adder.svg",imgfmt="svg"]
// \large
\[
\begin{array}{c}
c = x \land y \\
s = x \oplus y
\end{array}
\]

Just as side-note: It describes a halfadder.

*Edit* Improved grammar.
