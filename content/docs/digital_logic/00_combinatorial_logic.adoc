This course about digital logic is splitted into two big chunks:

1. Combinatorial circuits (without memory elements)
2. Sequential circuits (with memory elements)

While combinatorial circuits consists of boolean gates interconnected without feedback function, sequential gates posses 
a memory function,which makes them able to progress to another state.

A combinatorial circuit can have _n_ -wide vector of inputs and an _m_ -wide vector 
of outputs.

Combinatorial circuits can be described in different ways: As a formula, a circuit, a truth table or a Karnaugh map. All these descriptions are convertible into each other.

So lets get started with the fundamental logic gates and boolean algebra in the 
next post.
