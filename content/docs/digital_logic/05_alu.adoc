== The ALU, the swiss knife of every cpu

Today the author wants to introduce an important part of every cpu:
The arithmetic logic unit (ALU), we already know about some functions
presented in the blog posts before. In this post we want to close the
gaps systematically.
Time for a short recap: The logic functions 'and','or','not' and 'xor'
were introduced, also the arithmetic functions 'add' and 'sub' for integers
were shown. Now we want to build most of those functionalities in one unit,
the 1-bit alu cell.

=== A 1-bit ALU cell 
To keep things simple we implement an ALU for 1 bit,
which then can be adapted to every bitwidth simply 
by repitition. We introduce an implementation designed
by Hennessey and Peterson, quoted from the popular book
Computer Organization and Design (RISC-V) Edition by Hennessey and Patterson.

The implementation will support the fundamental operations 
'and','or', 'add' and 'sub'. As we already learned the subtraction 
can be realised two's complement: Inverting the input B and setting the carry-in to one.

=== Construct an n-bit ALU 

The 1bit ALU-cell we created in the first section, can be chained to an n-bit width-alu.
The last ALU-cell in the chain, differs a bit from the regular cell as it also includes
an overflow-detection circuit. We will get to it later in the article.

// == A 4-bit ALU
// 
// To keep things simple we show an example of an ALU with a bit
// width of only 4 bits, and only a few basic instructioins 
// But when the principle is clear it can easily 
// be extended to a wider bit width. (Inspired by 
// http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~mdamian/Past/csc2400fa13/assign/ALU.html[this site])
//

// 
// ==== Bitwise AND and OR
// For the bitwise logical operations we simply put in one gate per
// bit-slice. So every bit has a dedicated and-gate as well as one or-gate.

// ==== Addition and Subtraction
// 
// For the Addition we can decide between a simple ripple-carry-adder (RCA)
// or some type of carry-look-ahead adder (CLA). To keep it simple we choose
// the RCA, but be aware that this implementation becomes very slow for high
// bit widths!

// image:../images/how_does_cpu/fulladder_structure.svg[width="100%"]
// 
// We've also already seen how the subtraction can be implemented.This could 
// also be another dedicated circuit. But as we are smart we use the clever
// solution of XORs which does the inversion-part, and a carry-input of one for the lowest bit, 
// which does the increment-part of the two's complement, as we have already seen
// in one of the posts before. 
////

=== Set-less-than
We want the complete ALU to support another fundamental instruction set-less-than (slt), 
necessary to allow branch-operations later on. For this operation the addional input 'less'
is designed. So the ALU supports an instruction that in C looks like:
____
(a < b)?  1 : 0
____
 
This can be simply implemented by subtracting b  from a, and testing if the value is less than zero.
In the implementation, every alu-cell in the chain but the least-significant-bit, gets a zero on the 'less' input.
The first alu-cell gets the result of the last one, which is representing the most-significant-bit. As 
the msb also represents the sign bit, we can simply route as input to the least-significant and we are done.
This is - however - not true, in case the subtraction might result in an overflow. 

Also, we add a nor-gate with inputs from all result bits to detect zero.

==== Overflow Detection

The last 1-bit ALU cell in the chain has another output 'overflow', to indicate an overflow
of the addition of two integer values. 
The encourages the inclined reader to derive the truth table and circuit as an exercise.

//But instead of the propagated solution from Henessey and Patterson,
//the author wants introduce an alternative implementation 
//to find https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overflow-in-arithmetic-addition-in-binary-number-system/[here].

For a two's complement interpretation overflow occurs in two cases:

1. Two positive numbers are added, the result becomes negative
2. Two negative number are added, the result becomes positive

The truth table for overflow is as follows (original source can
be found http://teaching.idallen.com/dat2343/01f/notes/overflow.txt[here])

[options="header"]
|==================
| Binv| a(n-1) | b(n-1) | c(n-1) | OF 
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1

| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0
|==================

The circuit generated by Logisim is accordingly:

// To detect this a simple xor with the inputs of carry-in and carry-out is sufficient.

////
// ==== Extending the ALU
// As we can see, the previous ALU is a real minimal example.
// So we extend it with two additional logic operations NOT and 
// XOR. To keep the gate count low, we make clever usage of the XOR-gate
// in the half-adders.
// 
// image:../images/how_does_cpu/fulladder_structure_with_xor.svg[width="100%"]
// 
// Also we add eight inverters (4 for each input, A and B) 
// to the table.But to make use of all the whole new functions we need a few 
// more multiplexers.
// 
// image:../images/how_does_cpu/alu_schematic_extended.svg[width="100%"]
// 
// However if we have a look at the following truth table, we see that there
// is lot unused space. This is reserved for later extensions.

=== Multiplexer & Demultiplexer

To select one line out of multiple sources
we need another key component, the multiplexer.
We can find multiplexer in multiple places,
however in an ALU it used to select one of the logic 
or arithmetic operations, we will see that later.

image:../images/how_does_cpu/multiplexer_principle.svg[width="75%"]


The demultiplexer- as the name suggest- does the exact opposite task 
and distributes signal on one line (input) to one 
of multiple outputs, depending on the selection bit(s).

=== Multiplexer in complementary Pass-Transistor Logic

We show and implement the multiplexer in pass-transistor-logic,
as this is the most resource-efficient design...
