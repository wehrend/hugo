= The ALU, the swiss knife of every cpu

Today the author wants to introduce an important part of every cpu:
The arithmetic logic unit (ALU), we already know about some functions
presented in the blog posts before. In this post we want to close the
gaps systematically.
Time for a short recap: The logic functions 'and','or','not' and 'xor'
were introduced, also the arithmetic functions 'add' and 'sub' for integers
were shown.

=== A 1-bit ALU cell 
To keep things simple we implement an ALU for 1 bit,
which then can be adapted to every bitwidth simply 
by repition. We introduce an implementation designed
by Hennessey and Peterson, quoted from the popular book
Computer Organization and Design (RISC-V) Edition by Hennessey and Patterson.
We will slightly modify the original implementation.

The implementation will support the fundamental operations 
'and','or', 'add' and 'sub'. As we already learned the subtraction 
can be realised two's complemnet: Inverting the input B and setting the carry-in to one.
Further we will have the xor operation, spended by the fulladder cell.

// == A 4-bit ALU
// 
// To keep things simple we show an example of an ALU with a bit
// width of only 4 bits, and only a few basic instructioins 
// But when the principle is clear it can easily 
// be extended to a wider bit width. (Inspired by 
// http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~mdamian/Past/csc2400fa13/assign/ALU.html[this site])

// ==== Bitwise AND and OR
// For the bitwise logical operations we simply put in one gate per
// bit-slice. So every bit has a dedicated and-gate as well as one or-gate.

=== Multiplexer & Demultiplexer

To select one line out of multiple sources
we need another key component, the multiplexer.
We can find multiplexer in multiple places,however
in an ALU it used to select one of the logic 
or arithmetic operations, we will see that later.

The demultiplexer- as the name suggest- does the exact opposite task 
and distributes signal on one line (input) to one 
of multiple outputs, depending on the selection bit(s).

=== Multiplexer in complementary Pass-Transistor Logic

We show and implement the multiplexer in pass-transistor-logic,
as this is the most resource-efficient design...

// ==== Addition and Subtraction
// 
// For the Addition we can decide between a simple ripple-carry-adder (RCA)
// or some type of carry-look-ahead adder (CLA). To keep it simple we choose
// the RCA, but be aware that this implementation becomes very slow for high
// bit widths!

// 
// We've also already seen how the subtraction can be implemented.This could 
// also be another dedicated circuit. But as we are smart we use the clever
// solution of XORs which does the inversion-part, and a carry-input of one for the lowest bit, 
// which does the increment-part of the two's complement, as we have already seen
// in one of the posts before.

==== Overflow

The last 1-bit ALU cell has another output 'overflow', to indicate an overflow
of the addition of two integer values. It is only active for Additions. The derivation of 
the circuit from the truth table is left as exercise for the inclined reader.

// ==== Extending the ALU
// As we can see, the previous ALU is a real minimal example.
// So we extend it with two additional logic operations NOT and 
// XOR. To keep the gate count low, we make clever usage of the XOR-gate
// in the half-adders.
// 
// image:../images/how_does_cpu/fulladder_structure_with_xor.svg[width="100%"]
// 
// Also we add eight inverters (4 for each input, A and B) 
// to the table.But to make use of all the whole new functions we need a few 
// more multiplexers.
// 
// image:../images/how_does_cpu/alu_schematic_extended.svg[width="100%"]
// 
// However if we have a look at the following truth table, we see that there
// is lot unused space. This is reserved for later extensions.
