== The classic RS-flipflop

The classic flipflop consists of two Nand gates which outputs are feedback'ed to the complementary 
gate, as can be seen in the table below. Below the circuit the truth table is given.
As can be seen the flipflop locks the output to one state, '1' or '0'. 
If both inputs are set low, the output is undefined (and conforms to the preferred position).

One application of the classic RS-flipflop is to debounce switches.

But for most applications a more evolved flipflop is necessary. Let's have
a look at the (D)ata-flipflop.

== The D-flipflop

In the D-flipflop the circuit of the RS-flipflop is preceeded by two Nand gates,
controlled by a clock impulse. Only when the clock is high (i.e. '1') the date applied
to the (D)ata-input is valid and stored in the RS-fliplop. Otherwise the applied data 
input is invalid.
