As there are a lot of important applications for the exclusive-or (XOR) operation
it is dedicated an own blog post. Two of the most important are:

- An integral part of scrambler respectively descrambler which are an element in transmitters respective receivers
- Part of an encryption algorithmus
- Last but not least an important part of a halfadder.

as you can expect for a such basic and fundamental operation, but still
the situation is a bit different with this operation compared to 'and' and 'or'.

The exclusive-or operation xor which is also termed as antivalence
is denoted as A âŠ• B = Q. Its truth table is shown below
