=  *Introduction and Overview*

Every topic of this course is broken up into two parts:
A part about the mathematical side of digital logic,
ideally almost independent from implementation details
and a more practical part handling this very details.


==  *Boolean Algebra, basic logic gates and their implementation*


In this short post we will discover truth tables, boolean notation and learn about
De Morgan's laws.
Also we have a look at the most basic logic gates and why their are usually are not
implemented as such in electronics, having a look at NAND and NOR instead.


==  *Binary systems (I) unsigned integer and Combinatorial Logic (I)*


Here we explain the basic concept of how to count with only two different states at hand.
Also we will learn how to sum up two positive integer values in the binary system, derivate
the logic needed for a full-adder, to dive into the topic of combinatorial logic.


==  *First look into Memory and Look-Up-Tables (LUTs)*


In this post (chapter?) we learn, that - in principal - every form of combinatorial logic
can be transformed into 'software' by putting it into memory. In a practical example we will
show how a DDS sine wave generator use a Look-Up-Table (LUT) to replicate the sine.


==  *Binary Systems (II) signed integer*


Second part about the binary system. In this post we learn one- and two-
complement, endianess and about conversion to hex.


==  *Combinatorial Logic (II), a simple ALU*


We want close the first series by this second chapter about combinatorial logic.
We will use our new knowledge of the signed integer adding a subtract functionality
to our adder and also extending the adder to a full ALU


==  *Outline, what comes next*


In this first course we learned some basics about digital logic. But all these examples
use only static logic, we are still lacking a concept of how to store digital values.
We need to learn the concept of registers and sequenzial logic.
This will be the main topic of the second post series.
