      <description>Prequel Introduction to electronics  While I was about to write the implementation part of the boolean algebra post, the basic logic gates, the writing process got quickly out of hand and I caught myself to write more about less connected topics like explaining basic electronic components and their implementation on silicon than the actual content, here shall be the place for those excursions. This is not meant to be a complete reference more a supplement to existing literature.</description>

      <description>While drafting a blog post, part of a series of posts intended to be published in the future, I discovered a lack of my tooling in Nikola. When adding mathematical formulas, I realized that there is no default-way of rendering images from those math formulas, and inserting them as image-tags into the html. Instead math formulas are handled via JS, which I try to reduce to an absolute minimum on my site.</description>

      <title>Setting up a static blog with Nikola</title>

      <description>I picked up Nikola some months ago as I was searching for a simple static-site-generator to setup a blog with minimal effort.
 To make things a bit more interesting and at the same time easier we will use Nikola in a Docker container. So I require an almost basic understanding for Docker here.
 First create a directory on our host system, where you want the files stored, e.g. &amp;#39;blog&amp;#39; in your home directory.</description>
