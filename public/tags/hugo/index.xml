      <description>As the blog grow bigger and after the move to odoo, I noticed a gap in the workflow,since a blog and its content itself are different entities, I wanted to handle them as such, that led me to a cleanup of the original source code for blog, where I moved teh content folder into a different repo, called hugo_content, the former repo I called hugo_blog. ---
In my case, this means you have to clone the repo hugo_blog first go inside the new directory (cd hugo ), checkout its branch &amp;#39;hugo&amp;#39; and then do a clone of the repo hugo_content.</description>

      <description>Since one week my blog is build on the static-site-generator Hugo. I wanted to move to Hugo far earlier, due to the wide variety of themes. However this required the move from Asciidoc to Asciidoctor, and I experienced a few problems with the integration of Asciidoctor into my existing workflow. As the approach of rendering the latex-equations in the asciidoc-documents no loger worked, I decided to move on to client-based rendering of formulas, like done in KaTex and Mathjax.</description>
