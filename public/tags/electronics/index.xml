      <description>Introduction Rare earth elements have long been the backbone of high-tech magnets, with metals like neodymium and dysprosium playing pivotal roles in various industries. However, the scarcity and rising demand for these valuable resources have prompted researchers to seek alternative solutions. In an effort to reduce our reliance on rare earth magnets, scientists are exploring innovative materials and alloy combinations. Among the promising contenders is cerium, an abundant and accessible rare earth element, showing potential to replace or augment neodymium magnets.</description>

      <description>Introduction Rare earth elements, often shrouded in mystery, play a crucial role in our modern world. From smartphones to electric vehicles, renewable energy technologies, and even defense systems, these elements are the unsung heroes that make our daily lives more sustainable, efficient, and connected. In this article, weâ€™ll delve into the fascinating world of rare earth elements, with a focus on the versatile element, neodymium.
The Rare Earth Elements: An Overview Rare earth elements (REEs) are a group of seventeen chemical elements that occupy the lanthanide series of the periodic table, along with scandium and yttrium.</description>

      <description>Today I want to speak about op-amps. These wonderful, but mysterious components, we have heavely often appearing in circuit schematica of analog or analog / digital hybrid circuits. We want to demistify these components.
There are two basic thumb rules when handling ideal op-amp circuit. (Real-world op-amp circuits are a bit more complicated, but we will discuss this later).
1. The first thumb rule is that Vout is essentially the difference of the voltage values at the both inputs, multiplied with an arbitrary but high amplification factor A.</description>
