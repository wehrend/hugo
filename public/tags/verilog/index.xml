      <description>So, you decided you want to learn fpga programming and have done the prerequisite from the introduction 0 as well as done the simple logic circuit via quartus’s bdf files. Today we want to show you how to figure out Quartus by doing another hardware equivalent of the hello-World program used in the software world - we do program a binary counter showing of by the LED array we have available on our DE0-nano board.</description>
