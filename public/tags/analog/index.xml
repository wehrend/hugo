      <description>Today I want to speak about op-amps. These wonderful, but mysterious components, we have heavely often appearing in circuit schematica of analog or analog / digital hybrid circuits. We want to demistify these components.
There are two basic thumb rules when handling ideal op-amp circuit. (Real-world op-amp circuits are a bit more complicated, but we will discuss this later).
1. The first thumb rule is that Vout is essentially the difference of the voltage values at the both inputs, multiplied with an arbitrary but high amplification factor A.</description>

      <description>Today I want to speak about analog computers. In todays times analog computers are leading a shadowy existence, compared to their digital counterparts. But they are wonderous little machines. And that machines I mean wordly because there exists analog mechanical computers that are models from the world and used to compute and predict tides in certain areas of the world . Also the brain is an enourmous analog computer with a comparatively very small enery budget.</description>
