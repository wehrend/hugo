      <description>Today I want to start a blog post series about hardware programming. We start with an introduction to hardware programming with the FPGA-board DE0 Nano from former Altera now Intel. You see a picture of the small board below. It seems you can still order this board, but I have not tested.
We will show how to setup the environment, in the first step we will (show how to) download and install quartus on a Debian distribution, and configure the programmer.</description>
