      <description>When you fire up your browser to visit a website, you most probably did not noticed a very important mechanism underlying the browser and working in the background. Caching. Caches are used everywhere to optimize and improve access times and such in consequence the overall performance (of a site). Caching in the browser for example means, that ideally only the portions of the website that changed are loaded from the www.</description>

      <title>Odoo hacks: Remove Lock-Button from Odoo v12</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/web/04_odoo_hacks/</link>

      <description>Today I want to introduce a solution for a usability-problem I had in Odoo recently. In Odoo 12 there is a lock button next to the edit / save button, and you have to click both to (1) unlock the page and (2) make it editable. This should be done in one step, effectively removing the locking mechanism used in the Delivery Orders (class StockPicking) and Manufacturing Orders (class MrpProduction).</description>

      <title>Separating blog and content</title>

      <description>As the blog grow bigger and after the move to odoo, I noticed a gap in the workflow,since a blog and its content itself are different entities, I wanted to handle them as such, that led me to a cleanup of the original source code for blog, where I moved teh content folder into a different repo, called hugo_content, the former repo I called hugo_blog. ---
In my case, this means you have to clone the repo hugo_blog first go inside the new directory (cd hugo ), checkout its branch &amp;#39;hugo&amp;#39; and then do a clone of the repo hugo_content.</description>

      <description>Since one week my blog is build on the static-site-generator Hugo. I wanted to move to Hugo far earlier, due to the wide variety of themes. However this required the move from Asciidoc to Asciidoctor, and I experienced a few problems with the integration of Asciidoctor into my existing workflow. As the approach of rendering the latex-equations in the asciidoc-documents no loger worked, I decided to move on to client-based rendering of formulas, like done in KaTex and Mathjax.</description>

      <title>Setting up a static blog with Nikola</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/web/00_setting_up_nikola/</link>

      <description>I picked up Nikola some months ago as I was searching for a simple static-site-generator to setup a blog with minimal effort.
To make things a bit more interesting and at the same time easier we will use Nikola in a Docker container. So I require an almost basic understanding for Docker here.
First create a directory on our host system, where you want the files stored, e.g. &amp;#39;blog&amp;#39; in your home directory.</description>
