      <description>Since one week my blog is build on the static-site-generator Hugo. I wanted to move to Hugo far earlier, due to the wide variety of themes. However this required the move from Asciidoc to Asciidoctor, and I experienced a few problems with the integration of Asciidoctor into my existing workflow. As the approach of rendering the latex-equations in the asciidoc-documents no loger worked, I decided to move on to client-based rendering of formulas, like done in KaTex and Mathjax.</description>

      <title>Setting up a static blog with Nikola</title>

      <description>I picked up Nikola some months ago as I was searching for a simple static-site-generator to setup a blog with minimal effort.
To make things a bit more interesting and at the same time easier we will use Nikola in a Docker container. So I require an almost basic understanding for Docker here.
First create a directory on our host system, where you want the files stored, e.g. &amp;#39;blog&amp;#39; in your home directory.</description>
