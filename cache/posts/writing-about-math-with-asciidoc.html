<div class="paragraph"><p>While drafting a blog post, part of a series of posts intended to be published in the future,
I discovered a lack of my tooling in Nikola. When adding mathematical formulas,
I realized that there is no default-way of rendering images from those math formulas,
and inserting them as image-tags into the html. Instead math formulas are handled via JS, which I try
to reduce to an absolute minimum on my site.
So I started to implement a rather quick-and-dirty plugin to do exactly this transformation, using
latex and dvipng or dvisvgm.
Then I come across <a href="https://erikwinter.nl/articles/2020/why-i-built-my-own-shitty-static-site-generator/">this blog post</a>

Nikola, not the very best idea and continued manually.
After some frustrations with the paths for the latex filter inside asciidoc it was working.</p></div>
