<div class="paragraph"><p>What is electricity? Broadly speaken it is the flow of electrons in a conductor. In laymans term you can say,
electrons on the outer shell - also called as valence band - of an atom are hopping from the valenece band
of an atom to the adjacent one. So essentialy electricity constitutes the movement of electrons through matter.
In practical application this matter is an electrical circuit, but also for example the lightning discharge
occurs, in this case the ionised air can be considered as the (short) circuit.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The first group of elements (or compounds) we will introduce here are the conductors.
Some important representants of this group are the elements aluminium and copper
which both are indispensible for electric transmission lines and power grids.
As the table below depicts, both elements have free electrons available on it&#8217;s valence
shell, which as described above, are needed to allow the hopping of electrons from one atom
to another and thus allow movement of electrons, making the element (in its pure form) a conductor.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Of course in real world there are multiple factors counteracting to the idealized properties
proposed here. E.g. we have to consider among others that metals oxide when coming in contact
with oxygen, which builds up a thin but effectively isolating layer on the surface of the metal,
preventing a good contact. We might discuss such effects later. For now just let&#8217;s continue on the topic&#8230;</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>As we can see in below shown circuit schematics a voltage is just the difference between two potentials.
In the first example (left) the junction at the bottom is choosen as reference point, as it

Whereas in the example on the right the junction between the battery cells is choosen as reference point and ground.
The potential differences we measure  here are: U_A0 = 1.5V and U_B0 =-1.5V.
As a remark dual power supplies like that with - however with a voltage range of 12&#8230;15V - are often used for

<h2 id="_ohm_8217_s_law_and_lead_resistance">Ohm&#8217;s law and lead resistance</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Exercise: Measure Resistance</strong>
To execute the following exercise you need one voltagemeter and one amperemeter (or just two multimeters), a variable voltage source and
some sample wires of different materials but same in length and diameter.
If you do not have the equipment, in theory you could also simulate this exercise in <a href="http://qucs.sourceforge.net">Qucs</a> or
<a href="https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html">LTspice</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But as we need to upfront define the parameters of sample wires we want
to measure, this approach kinda torpedoes the purpose of the exercise, of learning how to do an indirect measurement of electrical
resistance.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Connect the equipment according to the figure shown below, with the sample wire as the resistor Rx.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><span class="image">
<img src="../images/electronic_basics/resistance_measurement_l.svg" alt="../images/electronic_basics/resistance_measurement_l.svg" width="550">
</span></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now, for every wire measure the voltage and the current and plot a graph of it with voltage on x-axis and current on y-axis.
You will see that for different materials, you get a linear graph but with a different slope. So you have find a relation
between voltage current and resistance. In addition after measuring the different wires you can also use pen &amp; paper: draw a line with
a pencil or scribble a small area. Now connect these with the probes of the measurement assembly. You will see, that also
the graphit trace work as a conductor - not an optimal one but a conductor.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This observance leads us to the most important formula you will encounter in an electrical engineering 101 course, Ohm&#8217;s law.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock latex">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/electronic_basics/ohms_law.svg" alt="../images/electronic_basics/ohms_law.svg">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When we rearrange this equation to its simpler interpretable form, U = R·I, we recognize, that the voltage drop (U) on the Resistor corresponds
to the resistance value ( R) times the current flowing thru (I). We did not speak about the current yet and we will postpone this to a later section.
As indicated in the brakets the unit of Resistance is Ω.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the image below the rules for series and parallel connection of resistors are shown.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><span class="image">
<img src="../images/electronic_basics/resistor_rules.svg" alt="../images/electronic_basics/resistor_rules.svg" width="500px">
</span></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For the series connection the values simply adds up like we have seen it for the voltage sources,
while for the parallel connection see same applies, however for the conductance G which is the reciproce
of the resistance R and measured in S(iemens).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So we discovered that the materials differ in their electrical conductivity - which is the reciprocal of the electrical resistance -
some are good (conductor) some are pretty bad and unusable (non-conductor) but nevertheless useful as dielectric, as we will see in
the next section and some in between.
We also need to note, of course that the conductivity is not only dependent on the material itself but also its geometries (further it is
also dependent on the temperature, but I will not go into this here), you know we handle with physics, so another useful formula / equation
in this context is the following.</p></div>

<div class="content">
<img src="../images/electronic_basics/wire_resistance.svg" alt="../images/electronic_basics/wire_resistance.svg">

</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For the most common rectangle form - like a strip conductor on a PCB  - area A resolves to width times height</p></div>
<div class="imageblock latex">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/electronic_basics/strip_resistance.svg" alt="../images/electronic_basics/strip_resistance.svg">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So the total resistance of a wire or a strip conductor on a PCB is dependent upon the specific resistivity ρ, the length
of the conductor and the area used to transfer the current. Logically the specific resistivity as well as the length of the conductor
increases the resistance while the area counteracts it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Why do we need to know this?</strong></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>At this point you may ask why it is important to know this if we can just pull a schematic of our DIY project and realize it with discrete components
on a breakout board- the answer is simple scale - it might work for this simple hobbyist example but lack scalibility,costs and / or reliability.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The further we get down on scale the more important parasitic effects become - we will learn about it in the subsequent sections.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Resistance measurement</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Below figure shows the principal of resistance measurement applied within a digital multimeter - leaving aside the range switch.
On the left side we have a constant current source, in the middle the resistor - or wire under measurement and on the left
a voltmeter measuring the voltage. As with the constant current source the overall current in the circuit is known, the resistance
can be scaled from that with the voltage measured.</p></div>
