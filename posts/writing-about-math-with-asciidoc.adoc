While drafting a blog post which is part of a series of posts I intended to publish in the future,
I discovered a lack of the tooling I use in Nikola. As I wanted to add mathematical formulas, 
I realized that there is no default-way of rendering images from those math expressions or formulas,
and inserting them as image-tags into the html. Instead math formulas are handled via JS which I try 
to reduce to the absolute minimum on my site.
So I started to implement a rather quick-and-dirty plugin to do exactly this transformation, using 
latex and dvipng or dvisvgm. 
Then I come across https://erikwinter.nl/articles/2020/why-i-built-my-own-shitty-static-site-generator/[this blog post] 
where I read about https://asciidoc.org/[asciidoc] written in python and its successor https://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor] written
in ruby supporting different display formats. Ideal for the content I had in mind. So I installed the Nikola plugin asciidoc 
(which is mostly a wrapper to the asciidoc binary called as a subprocess), via

 nikola plugin -i asciidoc

in my local environment and converted my blogpost(s) first semi-automatically which is, due to the metadata-section from 
Nikola, not the very best idea and so I continued manually.
After some frustrations with the paths for the latex filter inside asciidoc I got it working.

So as a sample of one of the future blogposts here one or rather two math-equations rendered this way:

["latex","../images/half-adder.svg",imgfmt="svg"]
\large
\[
\begin{array}{c}
C = X \land Y \\
S = x \oplus Y
\end{array}
\]

Just as side-note: It describes an halfadder.
