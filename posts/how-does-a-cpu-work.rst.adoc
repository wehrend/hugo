==  The Binary System


All computer we act with on a daily base do not know about the decimal system we are using, based on the ten digits at our hands.
All they know about are the states `on` and `off`. We build an imaginary circuit with a power source a control light - here an LED (Light Emitting Diode)  - and a switch,
closing the connection let the light flash. An off light counts as zero, and on light counts as one. Simple as it.We switch the light on
and get a one.

Now we extend this installation with a second light and switch left to current one. We switch the left light on and the right on. What we get as a result is a '2'.
Switching the right light on again gets us to 3. Like in our decimal system, the significance of the left light is higher (at least in our example), only the factor differs,
instead of 10 the factor is 2. We denote the significance with 2^n where n is the position of the light. Every switch is a bit - more exactly the switch is the input and the
LED is the output. So with four switches -half a byte - we can count from 0 to 15, while with eight switches - a byte - we can count from 0 to 255. This scheme can be extended as needed.

==  A simple adder


So now we know what the binary system is and how to count and add in. But if we want also to subtract we are still missing something - the knowledge how negative numbers are mapped in this system /logic.


==  One and two's complement


The figure below shows an illustration of the range of numbers on a circle.
the upper plane showing the positive interpreted numbers, the lower plane
the negative interpreted numbers.
