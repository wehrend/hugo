After drafting a blogpost involving math equation I realized I had a bit of a problem,
because all "modern" solutions of displaying math formulas involved a huge blob of JS,
which I am trying to aovid as much as possible. So I searched for a plugin, which goes 
through the markdown document (actually it was restructured text)  and replaces all math 
roles/dirctives with an image tag after generating the respective image from the source
expression. As I found no such thing I started to write such a plugin on my own.
After some fiddling with it I hear from asciidoc, and it seemed to be a perfect solution
not to my original problem but also to other - rather unrelated - ones, as having only 
one markup language from which I can generate the display format of choice. So I did switch
to adoc soon to no longer being locked in to *.rst .
